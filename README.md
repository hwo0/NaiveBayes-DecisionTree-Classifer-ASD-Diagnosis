# NaiveBayes-DecisionTree-Classifer-ASD-Diagnosis
(Python) Creating a Naive Bayes and Decision Tree model for the diagnosis of child Autism Spectrum Disorder

In this project, we conduct experiments based on 'Austism-Child-Data.arff' - a dataset
concerning the diagnosis of childhood Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening (ASDS). 

Using the individual characteristics available in the AQ-Child-10 Questerionnaire, our aim is to utilize both the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm
and the Decision Tree classifier to build predictive models for detection of ASD cases in children.
